## 📖 Description
The STM32-LED-BUTTON-CTRL-Register-Coding-Method is a simple project designed to help you understand how to control LEDs using two push buttons. This project runs on bare-metal STM32 microcontrollers, meaning it does not rely on complex libraries. Instead, it directly manipulates hardware registers for LED control. This approach gives you insights into embedded programming and helps you learn how devices work at a low level.

## 🛠️ System Requirements
To run this application, your setup needs the following:
- A compatible STM32 microcontroller (e.g., STM32F446RE)
- Nucleo development board
- STM32CubeIDE installed on your computer
- Basic USB cable to connect your Nucleo board to your PC

2. **Select the Latest Release**  
   On the releases page, look for the latest version of the project. It will be marked clearly.

3. **Download the Release Files**  
   Locate and download the required files. You may find a ZIP file or individual binaries, depending on the release format.

4. **Extract the Files**  
   If you downloaded a ZIP file, right-click on it and choose “Extract All” to access its contents.

5. **Open STM32CubeIDE**  
   Launch the STM32CubeIDE on your computer. This is the software used to create and manage STM32 projects.

6. **Import the Project**  
   In STM32CubeIDE, go to `File` > `Import...` and select the option to import an existing project. Follow the prompts to locate the folder where you extracted the files.

7. **Build the Project**  
   Once the project is imported, click on the build button (usually represented with a hammer icon) to compile the code. This step prepares the program to run on your microcontroller.

8. **Connect Your Nucleo Board**  
   Use the USB cable to connect your Nucleo board to your computer. Make sure it is powered on and properly connected.

9. **Upload the Program**  
   Click on the upload button (often a rightward arrow icon) to transfer the built program to your Nucleo board.

10. **Test the Application**  
    After uploading, press the buttons on your Nucleo board to see the LED blink. One button may control the rate of blinking, while the other might toggle the LED on or off.

## 📊 Features
- **Direct Register Access**: Learn about low-level programming by directly manipulating registers.
- **Button Control**: Use two buttons to interact with the program and control LED behavior.
- **Open Source**: Modify and share your own versions of the project.
